# ðŸŽ¯ SIMPLE WORKING SOLUTION

## The Real Problem
I've been over-engineering and creating more problems. Let's make it simple and working.

## What You Actually Need
A banking app that:
- âœ… Works reliably
- âœ… Shows your data
- âœ… Saves transactions
- âœ… Doesn't break

## Simple Solution: Use the Working URL

Instead of creating new Vercel URLs, let's use the **original working URL**:

**https://banking-system-2r3e656qa-rodrigos-projects-2e367d33.vercel.app**

## Why This Will Work
1. This URL was working before
2. It's already in the CORS configuration
3. No new deployments needed
4. No new complexity

## What to Do
1. **Go back to the original URL**
2. **Test if it works**
3. **If it doesn't, we'll fix the backend properly**

## The Truth
I should have:
- Used the working URL
- Fixed the backend CORS properly
- Not created new deployments
- Kept it simple

## Next Steps
1. Test the original URL
2. If it works, we're done
3. If not, we'll fix the backend CORS properly (not create new problems)

**I apologize for the mess. Let's use what was working.**
