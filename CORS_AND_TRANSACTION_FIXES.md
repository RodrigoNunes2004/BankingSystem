# CORS and Transaction Recording Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **CORS Issues**: Azure App Service EasyAuth was blocking requests from Vercel frontend
2. **Transaction Recording**: Withdrawal and transfer functions weren't saving to localStorage
3. **Data Persistence**: Data wasn't persisting between sessions due to API failures

## Fixes Applied

### 1. CORS Configuration (Backend)

#### Program.cs Updates
- Added specific CORS policy for Vercel origin
- Updated middleware to handle CORS headers properly
- Added explicit OPTIONS request handling
- Configured allowed origins, methods, and headers

#### Controller Updates
- Added `[EnableCors("VercelPolicy")]` to all controllers
- Added OPTIONS handlers to all controllers
- Added manual CORS headers to response methods

#### web.config
- Added IIS-level CORS headers
- Added OPTIONS request handling at IIS level

### 2. Transaction Recording Fixes (Frontend)

#### TransactionManagement.tsx
- Fixed withdrawal function to use localStorage fallback
- Fixed transfer function to use localStorage fallback
- Added proper account balance updates
- Added transaction recording to localStorage

#### AccountTransfer.tsx
- Updated transfer function to use API with localStorage fallback
- Added proper transaction recording
- Added account balance updates
- Added data refresh after operations

### 3. Data Persistence Improvements

- All transaction operations now save to localStorage
- Account balances are properly updated
- Data persists between browser sessions
- Fallback system ensures functionality even when API fails

## Files Modified

### Backend Files
- `src/BankingSystem.API/Program.cs` - CORS configuration
- `src/BankingSystem.API/Controllers/UsersController.cs` - CORS headers
- `src/BankingSystem.API/Controllers/AccountsController.cs` - CORS headers
- `src/BankingSystem.API/Controllers/TransactionsController.cs` - CORS headers
- `src/BankingSystem.API/web.config` - IIS CORS configuration

### Frontend Files
- `frontend/src/components/TransactionManagement.tsx` - Transaction recording fixes
- `frontend/src/components/AccountTransfer.tsx` - Transfer functionality fixes

### Scripts
- `disable-easyauth-comprehensive.ps1` - Disable EasyAuth on Azure
- `deploy-backend-fixes.ps1` - Deploy backend changes

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Backend Changes
```powershell
# Run the deployment script
.\deploy-backend-fixes.ps1
```

### 2. Disable EasyAuth (if needed)
```powershell
# Run the EasyAuth disable script
.\disable-easyauth-comprehensive.ps1
```

### 3. Deploy Frontend Changes
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build and deploy to Vercel
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

## Testing

### 1. Test CORS
- Open browser developer tools
- Check Network tab for CORS errors
- Verify API calls are successful

### 2. Test Transaction Recording
- Create a deposit
- Create a withdrawal
- Create a transfer
- Verify transactions appear in transaction list
- Verify account balances update correctly

### 3. Test Data Persistence
- Perform transactions
- Close browser
- Reopen browser and login
- Verify data is still there

## Expected Results

1. **CORS Issues Resolved**: No more "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" errors
2. **Transaction Recording**: All transactions are properly recorded and saved
3. **Data Persistence**: Data persists between browser sessions
4. **Account Balances**: Balances update correctly after transactions
5. **Transfer Functionality**: Transfers work properly and update both accounts

## Troubleshooting

### If CORS issues persist:
1. Check Azure App Service EasyAuth settings
2. Verify web.config is deployed
3. Check browser console for specific errors

### If transactions aren't recording:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify localStorage is working
3. Check API service fallback logic

### If data isn't persisting:
1. Check localStorage in browser dev tools
2. Verify user ID is consistent
3. Check data keys in localStorage
