# Mock Data Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Removed all hardcoded mock data from the banking system application to ensure it works with real data only.

## Files Modified

### 1. AccountTransfer.tsx
**Removed:**
- Hardcoded "Recent Transfers" section with fake transfer data
- Mock transfer items with fixed amounts and dates

**Replaced with:**
- Dynamic message based on actual account availability
- Empty state when no transfers exist

### 2. AuthContext.tsx
**Removed:**
- Hardcoded mock user data for login fallback
- Mock user registration fallback

**Replaced with:**
- API-only authentication (no fallback mock data)
- Proper error handling when API fails

### 3. InsuranceManagement.tsx
**Removed:**
- Large array of hardcoded insurance products
- Mock insurance product data with fixed prices and features

**Replaced with:**
- Empty products array (ready for API integration)
- TODO comment for future API implementation

### 4. CurrencyExchange.tsx
**Removed:**
- Extensive hardcoded exchange rates for multiple currencies
- Mock exchange rate data for USD, EUR, GBP, NZD, AUD, BRL

**Replaced with:**
- Empty exchange rates array (ready for API integration)
- TODO comment for future API implementation

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **No False Data**: Application no longer shows fake data that could confuse users
2. **API-First Approach**: Forces proper API integration instead of relying on mock data
3. **Real User Experience**: Users see actual empty states instead of fake populated data
4. **Cleaner Code**: Removed hundreds of lines of hardcoded mock data
5. **Better Testing**: Easier to test with real data scenarios

## Current State

- **Authentication**: Uses real API calls only
- **Transactions**: Uses localStorage with API fallback
- **Accounts**: Uses localStorage with API fallback
- **Insurance**: Empty state (ready for API integration)
- **Currency Exchange**: Empty state (ready for API integration)

## Next Steps

1. **Test Application**: Verify all functionality works with real data
2. **API Integration**: Implement real APIs for insurance and currency exchange
3. **Error Handling**: Ensure proper error messages for empty states
4. **User Experience**: Add helpful messages for empty states

## Files Ready for API Integration

- `InsuranceManagement.tsx` - Needs insurance products API
- `CurrencyExchange.tsx` - Needs exchange rates API

Both components now have proper empty states and are ready for real API integration.
